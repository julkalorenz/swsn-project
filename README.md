# Semantic web and social networks

This repository contains code used to conduct experiments for LLM assisted misinformation correction.

## Running the code

All of the Python dependencies are handled by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

After cloning the repository run to install packages:
```
uv python install
uv sync
```

Later to run a script (for example `script.py`) use:
```
uv run python script.py
```

## Repository Structure

* `data_prep.ipynb`notebook shows how the misinformation data is processed to create initial LLM prompts.
* `query_generation.py`is used to prompt an LLM with quries generated by methods used in `data_prep.ipynb`
* `context_gathering.py` is used to make a web search and scrape the results as context for future correction
* `correction_generation.py`is used to prompt an LLM for misinformation correction based on gathered context

* `data/fake_news/` `data/online_posts/` `data/tweets_correction/` are all datasets used to test the methodology. `data_prep.ipynb` shows how to process the data.
* `data_analysis.ipynb` contains an analysis of the data
* `data/processed/` contains examples of processed data
* `report/` contains source for files for the project report
