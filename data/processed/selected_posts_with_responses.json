        "post_context": "\nWind firms participating in the October 13-15 China Wind Power 2010 conference in Beijing boasted that they are up to the challenge. 'I can solemnly tell you that the quality of Chinese turbines is very good. The quality of Chinese turbines can rival that of international players,' declared Han Junliang, CEO of top Chinese wind turbine supplier Sinovel. He repeated his recent vow that exports will represent as much as half of Sinovel's sales. The company aims to establish branches in Europe, the US, South America, Australia and Canada. Zhang Dingjin is president of wind turbine blade maker China Composite Group. He said Chinese wind equipment suppliers want to take on their rivals in foreign markets. 'The components sector in China is very competitive,' he said. Others are champing at the bit, too. 'The Chinese state-owned banks and wind farm developers have aggressive plans to invest in wind power assets outside China, and other people are looking for that investment,' said Hubert Beaumont, wind engineering manager at Beijing-based consultancy Azure International, whose activities include helping Chinese developers identify wind pipeline abroad. Domestic investors are seeking ways to inject entire sections of the domestic wind industry into overseas markets. 'The Chinese want to develop projects overseas, using Chinese turbines, maintained by Chinese workers, financed by Chinese equity and debt - all China,' said Beaumont. Chinese lenders are expected to bankroll domestic turbine suppliers only until they prove their mettle overseas. 'The aim is to have Chinese wind turbines competitive and recognised by all international banks,' added Beaumont. Beyond the roost Among those ambitious developers at the conference was China Windpower. Listed in Hong Kong, it has more than 500MW of wind capacity operating in China and more under construction. Luo Maofeng, head of overseas business, said his firm plans to apply its experience in wind design, development, investment and plant operation around the world, starting off in emerging markets in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and elsewhere. Justin Wilkes, policy director at the European Wind Energy Association, has heard Chinese firms describe similar strategies. 'If any Chinese players come to Europe, they are more likely to look at the emerging markets and they will be looking offshore in the most established, mature markets - particularly the UK,' he said, adding: 'I don't think they will try to get into the more established onshore markets.' China has so far exported a combined 28.75MW of wind turbine capacity to the US, India, UK and Thailand, according to the 2010 China Windpower Outlook by the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and Greenpeace. Selling in saturated markets is one thing, but building factories and other operations is another, and many countries are welcoming Chinese investment. Panellists from Denmark, the UK and even the US, despite its recent protectionism slant, held presentations aimed at luring the Chinese to their shores. Ian Ross, senior international business executive at Scottish Development International, which facilitates Scottish overseas investment, commented that Chinese turbines will help Scotland meet its lofty green-energy ambitions. 'Encouraging Chinese companies to come to the Scottish market brings prices down. It brings down operating expenditures,' he said. Among the Asian turbine suppliers to already show interest in Scotland are China's Sinovel and Sany, as well as South Korea's Samsung, Hyundai and Hyosung. 'There is room in the market for everybody,' Ross added, noting that Scottish policy demands that 80% of all energy come from renewables by 2020. It will require between 7,000-8,000 wind turbines installed offshore between now and the target year. 'That will only happen through economies of scale. Even if European manufacturers operate their plants at full capacity, they cannot supply our needs. So we need new players,' said Ross, adding that he is counting on greater competition, sparked by Asian newcomers, to reduce installed costs to \u00a32 million/MW from the current \u00a33 million/MW. Financing Chinese forays abroad remains tricky but not impossible. Developer Datang, for its part, is planning to float shares of its clean-energy branch in Hong Kong, but the going may be rough. Debt-burdened wind turbine manufacturer Sinovel's plan to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai were suspended in October (windpowermonthly.com, October 28). And shares in fellow supplier Mingyang floundered after it launched on the New York Stock Exchange that month. Nonetheless, panellist Wang Haibo, general manager at Tianrun New Energy Investment, was positive. 'There is not really a shortage of funds,' he told delegates. 'If a project can bring (good) returns for shareholders, it is easier to get funds.' He said his company - a Goldwind subsidiary whose US unit has a stake in Minnesota's Uilk wind farm where three Goldwind turbines are spinning - hopes to apply models learned abroad to attract low-cost capital. And when the best candidates seek to float shares, investors may just be willing to bite. Charles Yonts, head of clean-energy research at Hong Kong-based CLSA Research, called the Hong Kong IPO market 'hot'. 'Equity is cheap right now,' he said. 'Doing an IPO in Hong Kong is almost guaranteed to get a good price-to-earnings valuation. There is a lot of money floating around and all this liquidity has to get soaked up.' Still, he cautioned: 'Who knows how long it will last?' Size and scope An expected easing in the growth of Chinese wind has not tempered long-term optimism for the home market. Experts say installation of wind capacity may slow this year, in part because tighter scrutiny by the executive board overseeing the UN's Clean Development Mechanism has resulted in fewer Chinese projects securing carbon financing (Windpower Monthly, November 2010). Chinese officials forecast that installed wind capacity will rise by about 10GW to 35GW by end-2010, compared with the 13.8GW added in 2009. But that is only part of the story. Steve Sawyer, GWEC secretary general, said China may overtake the US with the world's largest cumulative installed wind capacity by year end and, as 2020 approaches, it will represent an ever greater portion of new global power generation. GWEC's most optimistic outlook forecasts 250GW of cumulative installed wind in 2020 in China (see box, page 50) and many Chinese panellists spoke of as much as 300GW - many multiples of the government's now-farcical official target of 30GW. Conference data reflected the great expectations: more than 27,000 people, 5% above last year, visited an exhibition space almost double the size of last year. Of the 512 exhibitors, 26% were from outside China. Developing turbines Also growing at breakneck speed are the nameplate capacities of Chinese wind turbines. The day before the conference kicked off, Sinovel rolled China's first doubly fed 5MW turbine off its assembly line. Company vice-president Tao Gang said the machine was developed independently. Sinovel hopes to produce its first 6MW turbine in the first half of 2011, in time for what the company expects to be an explosion in the European offshore market within six years. CEO Han revealed: 'We are going to redouble our efforts to develop a share in the European offshore market, to strengthen our service capacity to our European customers.' He added: 'Our goal is 50-100% growth in terms of the supply of offshore wind turbines.' XEMC, for its part, soon afterward unveiled the country's first direct-drive permanent-magnet 5MW turbine specifically designed for offshore use. By year-end, it will install one unit in China and another in Europe (windpowermonthly.com, October 25, 2010). Goldwind also plans 6MW turbines. The trend of producing ever-larger wind turbines, particularly for offshore, has received the enthusiastic blessing of the Chinese science and technology ministry. There was the routine hand-wringing about Chinese quality, but with some surprises. Goldwind CEO Wu Gang said: 'The Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry still lags far behind world class in terms of research and development, management and internationalisation. We will very humbly learn from Vestas, Repower, GE - as well as other international leading companies - to grow even faster.' Qin Haiyan, secretary general of the Chinese Wind Energy Association, said recent surveys suggest that some of the biggest problems stem from manufacturers' poor quality control rather than from turbine design. Lax maintenance at wind farms is also a factor, he said. Some improvements are in the works. The China Electricity Council has submitted new national standards to the National Energy Bureau. If approved, these will make testing and certification of turbines and their components compulsory for wind farms - a requirement aimed at improving the integration of wind power to the grid, with improved quality a side benefit. Accreditation of wind technology is voluntary for now. More surprising was the vote of confidence, albeit qualified, in one Chinese supplier from Sebastian Meyer, director of research at Azure. 'For those who say there is no data - (that) nobody knows how any leading China original equipment manufacturer turbine is performing - and therefore it must be awful, is somehow also completely missing the message,' said Meyer. 'There is a real delivery of kilowatt hours going on.' Meyer cited Azure's one-year comparison of output from two projects separated by 17 kilometres in a region of north China. Under the same conditions and grid constraints, one used Sinovel 1.5MW turbines and the other 850kW units from Gamesa. Both models were designed for Class II wind conditions. 'It turns out that the pricing for these turbines in 2007 was quite similar. There was less than a 1% difference in price. But the output difference was more like 4% (in favour of the Chinese supplier)', Meyer said. 'So if we base a judgement only on this one-year example, you did get more bang for your buck with Sinovel.' This case did not answer long-term questions on part-replacement maintenance and various other things, Meyer stressed, concluding: 'The jury is out there. The race is on.' Tougher standards Goldwind chose the conference to show off its stride. On day one, it announced the successful test in August of low-voltage ride-through technology (LVRT) in the company's flagship 1.5MW direct-drive turbine. LVRT allows turbines to maintain operation without disturbance during sudden dips in voltage on the grid. The test, conducted by the China Electric Power Research Institute in Hebei province, followed an earlier successful test result of the technology in Germany in June. Goldwind's Wu added that Goldwind will now proceed to develop LVRT for 2.5MW and 3MW machines, as well as for the 6MW model it has in the pipeline. National standards soon to be promulgated by State Grid will require that wind turbines be equipped with LVRT to ensure steady operation of the grid. Chinese rivals have largely put off development of the technology on the grounds that grid operators antagonistic to wind will find excuses to turn away output from wind farms whether or not LVRT is installed. Offshore under scrutiny The race is on land and at sea. Wu told listeners that Goldwind 'cannot wait any longer to develop offshore wind power', lest China lag behind in offshore turbine design and wind farm construction technology. Every top Chinese wind turbine supplier has offshore turbines in the works. Sinovel has already installed 34 3MW turbines at China's first offshore wind farm, off Shanghai, and Goldwind plans to install a 6MW prototype offshore unit by June 2012. Smaller manufacturer Shanghai Electric earlier this year unveiled a 3.6MW offshore model (windpowermonthly.com, July 6, 2010). Meanwhile, developers bidding for offshore projects have professed willingness to endure losses due to low tariff prices just to grab a share of the domestic offshore market. But some top wind officials urge patience. Shi Pengfei, vice-president of the China Wind Energy Association, earlier this year suggested postponing offshore development after a study found that China's offshore wind resources may, in fact, be smaller than its terrestrial resources (windpowermonthly.com, July 8, 2010). And Li Junfeng, deputy director of the energy research institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the conference: 'Chinese wind power enterprises know little about offshore wind farms, as was the case with onshore wind farms six years ago.' Chinese wind industry officials estimate that costs at the country's offshore wind farm are three times those of onshore sites. Meantime, Wu Jincheng, Longyuan deputy director of renewable energy research, is worried that dismantling offshore wind turbines is too costly. Xie Changjun, general manager at Longyuan, China's oldest and largest wind farm developer, was confident offshore would succeed but concerned that Chinese offshore technology remains immature. Equally important, offshore wind farm construction methods need to improve, he said. And because grid operators can earn better margins on cheaper thermal power, he said they are likely to shun wind. Joining the chorus, Lu Yin, director of the Rudong Energy Bureau in east China's Jiangsu province, remarked: 'Denmark spent eight years to test, and is still testing, anti-erosion of wind turbines from sea water and the impact of turbine noise on marine creatures. What about us?' Eyes forward GWEC's Sawyer echoed a view widely held by his colleagues across the Chinese industry: focus on the grid. 'There are two main issues that need to be addressed in China,' he said. 'One is an increased emphasis on working with the state grid, and the other is transmission and distribution operation for an effective integration of Chinese wind power into the national grid. This way Chinese consumers and the economy can begin to reap a greater share of the benefits from the massive development that has happened here.' More broadly, he called for greater focus on efficiency of production resulting in 'a shift from focus on megawatts to megawatt hours' - just the kind of improvements that Azure's Meyer hinted were already taking place. 'Because, at the end of the day, our overall goal in the industry is to deliver the largest number of kilowatt hours of renewable electricity at the lowest possible cost,' Sawyer concluded. CHINA CENTRE STAGE - THE GLOBAL WIND ENERGY COUNCIL'S OUTLOOK REMAINS STRONG The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) chose the October 13-15 China Wind Power 2010 conference in Beijing to release its official prognosis for the industry. It was an apt choice of scene, considering Chinese wind dramatically outpaced GWEC's projections in its 2008 Global Wind Energy Outlook. That year, GWEC expected the country's total installed capacity in 2010 to reach 19.6GW in its most ambitious scenario, which assumed all available policy options 'along the lines of the industry's recommendations' were adopted. But last year, the actual figure was already 25.8GW; GWEC's advanced scenario for China in 2010 is 41GW. GWEC's latest outlook, coauthored by Greenpeace, blames China's low official target of 30GW total installed wind in 2020 - a level that may have been reached in mid-2010 - for delays in new electricity transmission unanimously deemed critical for additional wind capacity growth. These transmission problems, in turn, provide political cover for grid operators seeking to flout their obligations to buy power generated from renewables, says GWEC. Still, it expects the emphasis on infrastructure projects in China's 2008 economic recovery plan to produce much new transmission. Globally, GWEC forecasts that total installed capacity will reach 185GW this year under its most conservative 'reference' scenario or 198GW in its 'moderate' scenario. The reference, moderate and advanced scenarios for 2020 are 415GW, 832GW and 1.071TW, respectively. GWEC apparently sees little chance of the conservative projections coming to pass: They are based on the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2009 reference scenario, which GWEC openly questions. 'For this to happen, annual additions would need to decline substantially, especially in China, although there is no indication of this happening at present,' states Global Wind Energy Outlook 2010. 'Overall, the reference scenario seems disconnected from current developments, and curiously pessimistic,' it adds. Drivers GWEC 2010 includes among its underlying assumptions that wind turbine nameplate capacity - the maximum electricity output achievable when operating at full power - will continue to rise in coming decades. There will also be improvements in turbine capacity factors, the percentage of nameplate capacity that the machine delivers over the course of a year. GWEC estimates that the current average capacity factor is 25%, but 'improvements in both wind turbine technology and the siting of wind farms will result in a steady increase', it says. A sharp rise in wind power generation offshore, where winds are stronger and more constant and capacity factors much higher, will also help. As a result, GWEC expects that, across all three scenarios, the average global capacity factor will increase to 28% by 2015 and 30% by 2036. GWEC also foresees a decline in the cost of producing wind turbines. The average capital cost per kilowatt of installed wind power capacity was EUR1,350 globally in 2009, unchanged from the previous year. GWEC sees that as a peak. Under its advanced scenario, it expects that figure to drop to EUR1,328/kW this year and to EUR1,093/kW in 2030. That will be due to increased deployment of wind, which in turn will accelerate technological inroads, economies of scale and lower equipment costs. Global investment in wind will rise to EUR202.6 billion in 2030, from EUR57.5 billion this year, in the advanced scenario. The number of wind-related jobs will grow from about 670,000 in 2010 to more than 1.9 million in 2020 - and top 3 million in 2030.\n",
        "post_augmented_context": "\nThe scale and pace of China\u2019s clean energy transition, in both renewable generation and end-use electrification, has major implications for other countries. These include providing an example of how a huge and still-growing industrial economy can be transformed to run on clean energy, and producing a growing supply of ever-cheaper clean energy goods for the global market. \n \n\nGiven the sheer scale of China\u2019s energy system, its transition is bound to have global spillover effects, redefining the context in which every other country must chart its path to future prosperity. This chapter explores three key implications. First, China expands the possible through vast manufacturing scale, innovation and rapid deployment. Second, it has converted the emerging market energy leapfrog from concept into reality. Third, by scaling electro-technologies at unprecedented speed, China is creating the conditions to bring forward the global peak, plateau and decline of fossil fuel demand.\n\n3.1\nExpands the possible, by making electro-technologies cheap and big\nChina expands what\u2019s possible around the world in three key ways: manufacturing electro-technologies at enormous scale, driving down costs and expanding the technological frontier. No country has built manufactured technologies \u2013 of all kinds \u2013 at the scale China does today. Over the past 15 years, China has applied its manufacturing prowess to the core energy technologies of solar, wind, batteries, EVs and heat pumps. Together, these are technologies able to replace over three quarters of today\u2019s global fossil fuel demand.\n\nChina\u2019s electro-technology manufacturing capacity is now large, efficient and sophisticated enough to deliver the bulk of the goods needed for the global energy transition at prices affordable in most markets.\n\nSince 2010, the costs of solar PV, wind and batteries have fallen by between 60% and 90%, increasingly matching or beating fossil-fired competition. In 2024, 91% of new wind and solar projects commissioned were cheaper than the cheapest available fossil fuel alternative. The latest solar and battery prices make the combination competitive with fossil fuels in most sunny regions. In Viet Nam and India, the upfront costs of building a solar farm and a coal-fired power station are now comparable on a per-MWh basis, while only the coal-fired power station incurs ongoing fuel costs. \n\nIn electric vehicles, the long-standing rule of thumb has been that battery packs at $100/kWh achieve sticker price parity with Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. By July 2025, Chinese battery pack prices had plummeted to around $60/kWh. For consumers this means cheaper cars: each $10 per kWh decline in pack prices shaves about $500 off average-sized car production costs. In 2024, two-thirds of electric cars sold in China were cheaper than their ICE equivalents.\n\nThe core dynamics behind these global cost declines are learning-by-doing and increasing economies of scale, effects formally captured by Wright\u2019s Law, which states that costs fall as a function of cumulative production. From 2010 onwards, Chinese factories have accounted for about three-quarters of global solar module production. Once expensive, these technologies are now cost-competitive \u2013 and this is largely driven by China\u2019s rapid increase in production volume.\n\n\nThe scale of manufacturing in China means that it has grown to dominate electro-technology supply chains. In 2024, China produced four in five solar modules and battery cells globally, more than two-thirds of electric vehicles, and refined on average seven out of ten of the critical minerals that underpin them. That same year, Chinese companies also produced over half of the world\u2019s heat pumps, with a significant share destined for the export market.\n\nBut scale matters more than share. The International Energy Agency\u2019s Net Zero Roadmap, one of the most widely-used pathways to limiting global warming to 1.5C, requires 761 GW of solar capacity to be added globally per year in 2030. Already today, Chinese factories alone can theoretically supply that, and China\u2019s projected solar manufacturing capacity in 2030 (1,255 GW per year) is 65% higher than the IEA Roadmap deployment figure. Batteries tell a similar story: in 2024, Chinese battery manufacturing capacity was about 2,500 GWh, over double last year\u2019s global demand. By 2030, China is gearing up for 6,300 GWh per year of battery manufacturing capacity.\n\n\nThe result is a buyer\u2019s market: as hardware prices keep plunging, the consumer case for clean power and electric transport just keeps strengthening. The rapid scale\u2011up has also created cyclical overcapacity, compressing margins for manufacturers and increasing consolidation risk. But, from a purely technology perspective, Chinese industrialists have made climate scenarios look attainable. \n\nImportantly, analysts and policymakers worldwide who rely on cost figures even a couple of years old risk designing highly suboptimal technology pathways. Studies show that the costs of renewables are often overestimated in academic research. As academic conclusions frequently inform government modelling, there is a risk that governments may also overestimate energy transition costs by relying on outdated figures for technologies such as wind and solar power, battery storage, EVs and heat pumps.\n\nIf \u2018made in China\u2019 captured the country\u2019s role in the 2010s, \u2018invented in China\u2019 increasingly captures its role today. China has become the energy transition\u2019s science laboratory as well as its factory. China\u2019s share of patent applications globally in clean energy technologies has risen from around 5% in 2000 to around 75% in 2022 \u2013 including 90% in solar and wind, 85% in energy storage, and more than 70% in batteries and electromobility, based on IRENA\u2019s patent database.\n\n\nEqually striking is China\u2019s corporate Research and Development (R&D) spending in the energy sector, which has sailed past the US and Europe. In 2023, Chinese corporations invested ten times more in R&D in the electricity sector than their US counterparts. In concrete terms, this innovation acceleration has led to family-sized electric vehicles that charge in ten minutes for 400 km of range; batteries light enough to power heavy trucks and short-haul aircraft; offshore wind turbines as tall as the Eiffel Tower rated at 22 MW each; ultra-high voltage lines carrying 12 GW of desert solar power 3,300 km to coastal cities; and solar panels achieving 24% efficiency. In each case, it is a Chinese firm that is raising the ceiling of the possible; and the impact of raising the ceiling is global.\n\n3.2\nEnables the emerging market leapfrog\nChina is turning the \u2018emerging market energy leapfrog\u2019 from concept to reality. Its scale in the manufacture and export of affordable clean technologies, along deployment know-how, has contributed to faster adoption in many emerging markets. For comparison, in 2023, about one\u2011quarter of emerging markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America had higher economy\u2011wide electrification than the United States, and roughly 63% had a higher solar share in power generation. (See Methodology for definition of \u2018emerging markets\u2019.)\n\n\nCountries exceeding the United States in solar and wind generation shares span Africa, Asia and Latin America, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Kenya, Morocco and Namibia. While emerging markets\u2019 overall share of solar and wind generation remains below that of mature economies, it is growing faster. \n\nThe shift has perhaps been accelerated by measures that some governments have taken in an attempt to shield their own clean tech manufacturing sector from what they regard as China\u2019s uncompetitive practices. These include US bans and tariffs on imports of solar panels and components from China, extending recently to third countries. If sustained and broadened, such measures could fragment supply chains and slow deployment timelines in some markets. On the other hand, they may increase availability for others as restrictions on imports by one country can create more of a buyer\u2019s market for others. \n\nMeanwhile, electrification leaders range from Mexico and Chile to Egypt, Bangladesh, and Viet Nam, with rapid progress particularly evident in Asia, where Chinese technologies are more accessible. Just as electricity networks once spread outward from pioneers like New York and Berlin, electricity-first industrialisation is now radiating from eastern China to Southeast Asia. Countries where electricity\u2019s share of final energy is rising quickly include Viet Nam, Laos, Malaysia and Bangladesh.\n\nChina\u2019s solar exports tripled in five years, reaching 242 GW in 2024, with around half going to emerging markets. In many countries, this is already adding materially to their capacity to generate electricity. Since 2018, Chinese solar exports to Namibia, Senegal, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Pakistan have all been larger than their entire centralised capacity as of 2023. Imports to Kenya, Yemen, Sri Lanka and Tanzania have been more than half the size of their centralised electricity systems. Brazil has imported about 90 GW of solar capacity from China (in an electricity system with a total generation capacity of 274 GW, as of July 2025). In other words, new energy is achieving in years what took old energy decades. \n\n\nRapid module price declines have improved the affordability of solar. Solar module prices fell over 70% between 2022 and mid-2025, down to $0.08/W for spot purchases in China. In some places, this is materially changing people\u2019s prospects of gaining access to modern energy. At these prices, it would take a $20 module cost for the average person in Sub-Saharan Africa to double their electricity consumption. In illustrative terms, multiply the module cost fivefold to cover inverters, wiring, supplier margins and logistics costs, and the whole kit still comes in, on an upfront basis, below the price of a Tecno Pop 8 smartphone, a top seller in African markets. On a levelised cost of electricity basis, these prices make a small solar PV kit far cheaper than a stand-alone diesel generator. Using solar panels to double the total electricity consumption of the 1.25 billion population of Sub-Saharan Africa would cost about $25bn for modules at present spot prices \u2013 about the amount the region spends every year on fuel for stand-alone generators. The scale of China\u2019s solar manufacturing is such that even using just one-seventh of projected \u2018spare\u2019 manufacturing capacity by 2030 could provide basic electricity access to everyone still without power across 88 low-income countries in Africa and other regions of the world. \n\nRealising these gains depends on non\u2011module costs and delivery constraints (soft costs, taxes, logistics, storage for reliability, quality assurance and after\u2011sales service), as well as financing and policy. In many contexts, utility\u2011scale and distributed solar can be deployed faster than new fossil gas capacity, and it reduces exposure to imported fuel price volatility and local air pollution.\n\nWhere solar goes, batteries are following. In 2024, China exported $61 billion USD worth of batteries, with a quarter of this going to emerging markets, where they both help to integrate higher levels of variable solar generation into the electricity system and build domestic automotive industries. One of the most significant trends in the auto trade is that over the past decade, China has evolved from being a net car importer into the world\u2019s largest exporter.\n\n\nA growing share of these car exports consists of EVs, up from 7% in 2020 to 41% in the first five months of 2025. In 2024, emerging markets overtook the European Union as China\u2019s largest EV destination. Exports to emerging markets surged from $0.5 billion in 2020 to $16.5 billion in 2024.\n\nPrice comparisons indicate that Chinese EVs are often priced below local ICE alternatives. In Thailand, the average market price of a Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV) in 2024 was around $30,000 USD, versus a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) at approximately $34,000. In Mexico and Brazil, the BYD Dolphin Mini launched at around $20,000. With the BYD Seagull retailing in China at under $8,000, export pricing could be lower over time, subject to tariffs, taxes, logistics and local\u2011content rules.\n\nIn some cases Chinese companies are also committing capital and technical expertise to local production. Since 2020, Chinese EV and battery companies have announced around $80 billion to build production facilities in markets such as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil. \n\nChina has also announced diplomatic and financing initiatives to support renewables deployment in Africa, including a three\u2011year plan launched in 2024 with pledges on solar rollout, project development and funds to localise supply chains. Amid concerns over African nations\u2019 debt levels with respect to China \u2013 some linked to earlier energy-sector loans \u2013 there are signs that more sustainable financing approaches are being explored. These include a gradual shift in some cases toward investment-based models and concessional finance, along with stronger oversight mechanisms. \n\nSome analysts view the combined emphasis on clean energy deployment and manufacturing, which China is pursuing domestically and in some cases supporting in other emerging economies, as a departure from the historic development pathway of \u201cgrow first, clean up later\u201d, potentially aligning a country\u2019s economic and environmental goals. The extent to which this materialises will vary by country policy, financing conditions and local capabilities.\n\n3.3\nChina\u2019s transition is reshaping the global fossil fuel demand outlook\nChina\u2019s energy\u2011related fossil fuel demand appears to be approaching a plateau \u2013with possible decline ahead \u2013 and this will be significant for the fossil fuel production industry the world over. In the past decade, China has been the single largest driver of global growth in fossil fuel use, responsible for about two-thirds of the global increase in primary demand; and in the power sector, accounting for almost 80% of the rise in fossil generation. \n\nAs we outlined in Chapter 1, the accelerating rollout of renewable generation is set to tip China\u2019s power sector fossil fuel use into decline soon. Outside the power sector, in buildings, industry and transport, final energy-related fossil fuel use has broadly plateaued, with decline possible if current trends persist. Whether this materialises depends on economic growth, hydrology, export demand, policy execution and grid integration. \n\nFossil fuel use across the OECD has fallen since around 2009. If China\u2019s demand also declines, countries representing more than half of global use would be in contraction.\n\nOutside China, uptake of clean electro-technology \u2013 made more affordable largely by China\u2019s manufacturing scale \u2013 is helping mature and emerging economies alike to accelerate their own transitions. In 2024, clean energy goods exported from China shaved the carbon emissions of importing countries by an estimated 1%, by implication cutting their fossil fuel demand by a similar amount. \n\nIf these trends continue, it\u2019s likely that the world\u2019s fossil fuel demand will be in structural decline by 2030.\n\n\nEntering an era of falling fossil fuel demand will have profound implications for a number of countries. Governments planning to achieve economic growth by stimulating fossil fuel production face an immediate challenge, especially if investors respond logically to the global trend. While the fossil fuel sector contracts, electro-technology will continue to get cheaper as its use and manufacture expands, and as it achieves social acceptance worldwide. \n\nFalling fossil fuel demand will also change the politics of climate change, keeping the goals of the Paris Agreement within play, and cementing alliances between governments that want to grasp the opportunity which cheap electro-technologies are delivering. \n",

'I can solemnly tell you that the quality of Chinese turbines is very good. The quality of Chinese turbines can rival that of international players,' declared Han Junliang, CEO of top Chinese wind turbine supplier Sinovel. He repeated his recent vow that exports will represent as much as half of Sinovel's sales. The company aims to establish branches in Europe, the US, South America, Australia and Canada. Zhang Dingjin is president of wind turbine blade maker China Composite Group. He said Chinese wind equipment suppliers want to take on their rivals in foreign markets. 'The components sector in China is very competitive,' he said. Others are champing at the bit, too. 'The Chinese state-owned banks and wind farm developers have aggressive plans to invest in wind power assets outside China, and other people are looking for that investment,' said Hubert Beaumont, wind engineering manager at Beijing-based consultancy Azure International, whose activities include helping Chinese developers identify wind pipeline abroad. Domestic investors are seeking ways to inject entire sections of the domestic wind industry into overseas markets. 'The Chinese want to develop projects overseas, using Chinese turbines, maintained by Chinese workers, financed by Chinese equity and debt - all China,' said Beaumont. Chinese lenders are expected to bankroll domestic turbine suppliers only until they prove their mettle overseas. 'The aim is to have Chinese wind turbines competitive and recognised by all international banks,' added Beaumont. Beyond the roost Among those ambitious developers at the conference was China Windpower. Listed in Hong Kong, it has more than 500MW of wind capacity operating in China and more under construction. Luo Maofeng, head of overseas business, said his firm plans to apply its experience in wind design, development, investment and plant operation around the world, starting off in emerging markets in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and elsewhere. Justin Wilkes, policy director at the European Wind Energy Association, has heard Chinese firms describe similar strategies. 'If any Chinese players come to Europe, they are more likely to look at the emerging markets and they will be looking offshore in the most established, mature markets - particularly the UK,' he said, adding: 'I don't think they will try to get into the more established onshore markets.' China has so far exported a combined 28.75MW of wind turbine capacity to the US, India, UK and Thailand, according to the 2010 China Windpower Outlook by the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and Greenpeace. Selling in saturated markets is one thing, but building factories and other operations is another, and many countries are welcoming Chinese investment. Panellists from Denmark, the UK and even the US, despite its recent protectionism slant, held presentations aimed at luring the Chinese to their shores. Ian Ross, senior international business executive at Scottish Development International, which facilitates Scottish overseas investment, commented that Chinese turbines will help Scotland meet its lofty green-energy ambitions. 'Encouraging Chinese companies to come to the Scottish market brings prices down. It brings down operating expenditures,' he said. Among the Asian turbine suppliers to already show interest in Scotland are China's Sinovel and Sany, as well as South Korea's Samsung, Hyundai and Hyosung. 'There is room in the market for everybody,' Ross added, noting that Scottish policy demands that 80% of all energy come from renewables by 2020. It will require between 7,000-8,000 wind turbines installed offshore between now and the target year. 'That will only happen through economies of scale. Even if European manufacturers operate their plants at full capacity, they cannot supply our needs. So we need new players,' said Ross, adding that he is counting on greater competition, sparked by Asian newcomers, to reduce installed costs to \u00a32 million/MW from the current \u00a33 million/MW. Financing Chinese forays abroad remains tricky but not impossible. Developer Datang, for its part, is planning to float shares of its clean-energy branch in Hong Kong, but the going may be rough. Debt-burdened wind turbine manufacturer Sinovel's plan to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai were suspended in October (windpowermonthly.com, October 28). And shares in fellow supplier Mingyang floundered after it launched on the New York Stock Exchange that month. Nonetheless, panellist Wang Haibo, general manager at Tianrun New Energy Investment, was positive. 'There is not really a shortage of funds,' he told delegates. 'If a project can bring (good) returns for shareholders, it is easier to get funds.' He said his company - a Goldwind subsidiary whose US unit has a stake in Minnesota's Uilk wind farm where three Goldwind turbines are spinning - hopes to apply models learned abroad to attract low-cost capital. And when the best candidates seek to float shares, investors may just be willing to bite. Charles Yonts, head of clean-energy research at Hong Kong-based CLSA Research, called the Hong Kong IPO market 'hot'. 'Equity is cheap right now,' he said. 'Doing an IPO in Hong Kong is almost guaranteed to get a good price-to-earnings valuation. There is a lot of money floating around and all this liquidity has to get soaked up.' Still, he cautioned: 'Who knows how long it will last?' Size and scope An expected easing in the growth of Chinese wind has not tempered long-term optimism for the home market. Experts say installation of wind capacity may slow this year, in part because tighter scrutiny by the executive board overseeing the UN's Clean Development Mechanism has resulted in fewer Chinese projects securing carbon financing (Windpower Monthly, November 2010). Chinese officials forecast that installed wind capacity will rise by about 10GW to 35GW by end-2010, compared with the 13.8GW added in 2009. But that is only part of the story. Steve Sawyer, GWEC secretary general, said China may overtake the US with the world's largest cumulative installed wind capacity by year end and, as 2020 approaches, it will represent an ever greater portion of new global power generation. GWEC's most optimistic outlook forecasts 250GW of cumulative installed wind in 2020 in China (see box, page 50) and many Chinese panellists spoke of as much as 300GW - many multiples of the government's now-farcical official target of 30GW. Conference data reflected the great expectations: more than 27,000 people, 5% above last year, visited an exhibition space almost double the size of last year. Of the 512 exhibitors, 26% were from outside China. Developing turbines Also growing at breakneck speed are the nameplate capacities of Chinese wind turbines. The day before the conference kicked off, Sinovel rolled China's first doubly fed 5MW turbine off its assembly line. Company vice-president Tao Gang said the machine was developed independently. Sinovel hopes to produce its first 6MW turbine in the first half of 2011, in time for what the company expects to be an explosion in the European offshore market within six years. CEO Han revealed: 'We are going to redouble our efforts to develop a share in the European offshore market, to strengthen our service capacity to our European customers.' He added: 'Our goal is 50-100% growth in terms of the supply of offshore wind turbines.' XEMC, for its part, soon afterward unveiled the country's first direct-drive permanent-magnet 5MW turbine specifically designed for offshore use. By year-end, it will install one unit in China and another in Europe (windpowermonthly.com, October 25, 2010). Goldwind also plans 6MW turbines. The trend of producing ever-larger wind turbines, particularly for offshore, has received the enthusiastic blessing of the Chinese science and technology ministry. There was the routine hand-wringing about Chinese quality, but with some surprises. Goldwind CEO Wu Gang said: 'The Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry still lags far behind world class in terms of research and development, management and internationalisation. We will very humbly learn from Vestas, Repower, GE - as well as other international leading companies - to grow even faster.' Qin Haiyan, secretary general of the Chinese Wind Energy Association, said recent surveys suggest that some of the biggest problems stem from manufacturers' poor quality control rather than from turbine design. Lax maintenance at wind farms is also a factor, he said. Some improvements are in the works. The China Electricity Council has submitted new national standards to the National Energy Bureau. If approved, these will make testing and certification of turbines and their components compulsory for wind farms - a requirement aimed at improving the integration of wind power to the grid, with improved quality a side benefit. Accreditation of wind technology is voluntary for now. More surprising was the vote of confidence, albeit qualified, in one Chinese supplier from Sebastian Meyer, director of research at Azure. 'For those who say there is no data - (that) nobody knows how any leading China original equipment manufacturer turbine is performing - and therefore it must be awful, is somehow also completely missing the message,' said Meyer. 'There is a real delivery of kilowatt hours going on.' Meyer cited Azure's one-year comparison of output from two projects separated by 17 kilometres in a region of north China. Under the same conditions and grid constraints, one used Sinovel 1.5MW turbines and the other 850kW units from Gamesa. Both models were designed for Class II wind conditions. 'It turns out that the pricing for these turbines in 2007 was quite similar. There was less than a 1% difference in price. But the output difference was more like 4% (in favour of the Chinese supplier)', Meyer said. 'So if we base a judgement only on this one-year example, you did get more bang for your buck with Sinovel.' This case did not answer long-term questions on part-replacement maintenance and various other things, Meyer stressed, concluding: 'The jury is out there. The race is on.' Tougher standards Goldwind chose the conference to show off its stride. On day one, it announced the successful test in August of low-voltage ride-through technology (LVRT) in the company's flagship 1.5MW direct-drive turbine. LVRT allows turbines to maintain operation without disturbance during sudden dips in voltage on the grid. The test, conducted by the China Electric Power Research Institute in Hebei province, followed an earlier successful test result of the technology in Germany in June. Goldwind's Wu added that Goldwind will now proceed to develop LVRT for 2.5MW and 3MW machines, as well as for the 6MW model it has in the pipeline. National standards soon to be promulgated by State Grid will require that wind turbines be equipped with LVRT to ensure steady operation of the grid. Chinese rivals have largely put off development of the technology on the grounds that grid operators antagonistic to wind will find excuses to turn away output from wind farms whether or not LVRT is installed. Offshore under scrutiny The race is on land and at sea. Wu told listeners that Goldwind 'cannot wait any longer to develop offshore wind power', lest China lag behind in offshore turbine design and wind farm construction technology. Every top Chinese wind turbine supplier has offshore turbines in the works. Sinovel has already installed 34 3MW turbines at China's first offshore wind farm, off Shanghai, and Goldwind plans to install a 6MW prototype offshore unit by June 2012. Smaller manufacturer Shanghai Electric earlier this year unveiled a 3.6MW offshore model (windpowermonthly.com, July 6, 2010). Meanwhile, developers bidding for offshore projects have professed willingness to endure losses due to low tariff prices just to grab a share of the domestic offshore market. But some top wind officials urge patience. Shi Pengfei, vice-president of the China Wind Energy Association, earlier this year suggested postponing offshore development after a study found that China's offshore wind resources may, in fact, be smaller than its terrestrial resources (windpowermonthly.com, July 8, 2010). And Li Junfeng, deputy director of the energy research institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the conference: 'Chinese wind power enterprises know little about offshore wind farms, as was the case with onshore wind farms six years ago.' Chinese wind industry officials estimate that costs at the country's offshore wind farm are three times those of onshore sites. Meantime, Wu Jincheng, Longyuan deputy director of renewable energy research, is worried that dismantling offshore wind turbines is too costly. Xie Changjun, general manager at Longyuan, China's oldest and largest wind farm developer, was confident offshore would succeed but concerned that Chinese offshore technology remains immature. Equally important, offshore wind farm construction methods need to improve, he said. And because grid operators can earn better margins on cheaper thermal power, he said they are likely to shun wind. Joining the chorus, Lu Yin, director of the Rudong Energy Bureau in east China's Jiangsu province, remarked: 'Denmark spent eight years to test, and is still testing, anti-erosion of wind turbines from sea water and the impact of turbine noise on marine creatures. What about us?' Eyes forward GWEC's Sawyer echoed a view widely held by his colleagues across the Chinese industry: focus on the grid. 'There are two main issues that need to be addressed in China,' he said. 'One is an increased emphasis on working with the state grid, and the other is transmission and distribution operation for an effective integration of Chinese wind power into the national grid. This way Chinese consumers and the economy can begin to reap a greater share of the benefits from the massive development that has happened here.' More broadly, he called for greater focus on efficiency of production resulting in 'a shift from focus on megawatts to megawatt hours' - just the kind of improvements that Azure's Meyer hinted were already taking place. 'Because, at the end of the day, our overall goal in the industry is to deliver the largest number of kilowatt hours of renewable electricity at the lowest possible cost,' Sawyer concluded. CHINA CENTRE STAGE - THE GLOBAL WIND ENERGY COUNCIL'S OUTLOOK REMAINS STRONG The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) chose the October 13-15 China Wind Power 2010 conference in Beijing to release its official prognosis for the industry. It was an apt choice of scene, considering Chinese wind dramatically outpaced GWEC's projections in its 2008 Global Wind Energy Outlook. That year, GWEC expected the country's total installed capacity in 2010 to reach 19.6GW in its most ambitious scenario, which assumed all available policy options 'along the lines of the industry's recommendations' were adopted. But last year, the actual figure was already 25.8GW; GWEC's advanced scenario for China in 2010 is 41GW. GWEC's latest outlook, coauthored by Greenpeace, blames China's low official target of 30GW total installed wind in 2020 - a level that may have been reached in mid-2010 - for delays in new electricity transmission unanimously deemed critical for additional wind capacity growth. These transmission problems, in turn, provide political cover for grid operators seeking to flout their obligations to buy power generated from renewables, says GWEC. Still, it expects the emphasis on infrastructure projects in China's 2008 economic recovery plan to produce much new transmission. Globally, GWEC forecasts that total installed capacity will reach 185GW this year under its most conservative 'reference' scenario or 198GW in its 'moderate' scenario. The reference, moderate and advanced scenarios for 2020 are 415GW, 832GW and 1.071TW, respectively. GWEC apparently sees little chance of the conservative projections coming to pass: They are based on the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2009 reference scenario, which GWEC openly questions. 'For this to happen, annual additions would need to decline substantially, especially in China, although there is no indication of this happening at present,' states Global Wind Energy Outlook 2010. 'Overall, the reference scenario seems disconnected from current developments, and curiously pessimistic,' it adds. Drivers GWEC 2010 includes among its underlying assumptions that wind turbine nameplate capacity - the maximum electricity output achievable when operating at full power - will continue to rise in coming decades. There will also be improvements in turbine capacity factors, the percentage of nameplate capacity that the machine delivers over the course of a year. GWEC estimates that the current average capacity factor is 25%, but 'improvements in both wind turbine technology and the siting of wind farms will result in a steady increase', it says. A sharp rise in wind power generation offshore, where winds are stronger and more constant and capacity factors much higher, will also help. As a result, GWEC expects that, across all three scenarios, the average global capacity factor will increase to 28% by 2015 and 30% by 2036. GWEC also foresees a decline in the cost of producing wind turbines. The average capital cost per kilowatt of installed wind power capacity was EUR1,350 globally in 2009, unchanged from the previous year. GWEC sees that as a peak. Under its advanced scenario, it expects that figure to drop to EUR1,328/kW this year and to EUR1,093/kW in 2030. That will be due to increased deployment of wind, which in turn will accelerate technological inroads, economies of scale and lower equipment costs. Global investment in wind will rise to EUR202.6 billion in 2030, from EUR57.5 billion this year, in the advanced scenario. The number of wind-related jobs will grow from about 670,000 in 2010 to more than 1.9 million in 2020 - and top 3 million in 2030.\n\n",

        "post_augmented_context": "Gov. Rick Perry says Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state\nDuring his State of the State address, Gov. Rick Perry countered those 'painting a pretty grim picture' of Texas finances 'with the good news that continues to flow from our comparatively strong economy.'\n\n'Have the doomsayers forgotten that Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state?' he said in the Feb. 8 speech.\n\nWe\u2019ve checked other claims about Texas\u2019 job growth, including Perry\u2019s statement in June that Texas had added more jobs than the other states combined. We rated that True; from January 2001 to June 2010, Texas had a net gain of 853,400 jobs.\n\nEarlier, we rated another statement False: In January, Perry claimed that approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-08 were in Texas, based on data from the Texas Workforce Commission, where number-crunchers said they added the total jobs created in the 13 job-gaining states during the one-year period. But the calculation behind his statement discounted jobs created in states that had an overall job loss.\n\nWe wondered if Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas gained in 2010.\n\nPerry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a Jan. 25 federal report detailing states\u2019 employment and unemployment during the last year. According to the report, 'the largest statistically significant' net job gain was in Texas,' with 230,800 jobs, ahead of Pennsylvania (65,600) and Illinois (46,300). The report says the 'only statistically significant decrease in employment occurred in New Jersey,' which had a net job loss of 30,700 jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even states that had a net-job losses likely saw some new jobs \u2014 though not enough to offset the jobs they lost.\n\nBut Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, agreed that based on preliminary December data, Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas added last year: 'We did have the largest over-the-year employment,' she said, later adding that 'Texas would have certainly beaten any state with a loss.' She likewise pointed us to the January bureau report noted by Frazier.\n\nAccording to preliminary December 2010 data in the report, Texas had the largest employment increase that month, adding about 20,000 jobs, followed by South Carolina, which added some 9,000 jobs.\n\nAbbot also told us that among the states, Texas had a 2.3 percent increase in jobs in 2010. New Hampshire came in second with a 2.1 percent job increase.\n\nFinally, we wondered how well the new jobs pay. Abbot told us that while the bureau tracks average hourly earnings for most industry sectors, 'the data will only give you averages across all workers in the industry, nothing about \u2018new\u2019 versus \u2018old\u2019 jobs.'\n\nRegardless of how the new jobs paid, Texas added more of them \u2014  based on net job gains \u2014 in 2010 than any other state.

([PolitiFact][1])\n\n**Why this is misleading**:\n\n* Fort Worth\u2019s population in 2010 was about **741,206** (according to the city\u2019s 2010 records). ([Wikipedia][2])\n* But the \u201c850,000 jobs added\u201d refers to **jobs added over a multi-year period** \u2014 not \u201con or around October 13, 2010.\u201d According to state-level data for fiscal 2010, Texas added **129,100 jobs** that year. ([TX Almanac][3])\n\nHence, presenting the 850,000-job figure as \u201cnew jobs as of a specific date\u201d distorts the timeframe. The comparison conflates cumulative growth over time with a snapshot of population, which makes the claim misleading.\n\n**Conclusion**: Because the jobs-added number covers a broader interval \u2014 not just \u201con\u201d October 13 2010 \u2014 the statement misrepresents the timing and exaggerates the comparison.\n\n[1]: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/oct/25/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-more-texans-have-new-jobs-popu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Gov.

        "post_augmented_context": "When I teach economics, I try to drive home the lesson that words are supposed to mean something coherent. If you want to be rewarded for stringing together a bunch of empty phrases, you should go take an English class.\n\nI was therefore maximally sympathetic to the poor XM radio host (I think it was Pete Dominick but I\u2019m not sure) who was stuck interviewing a man named John Sakowicz last Friday. Sakowicz, who hosts his own radio show in northern California, was there to warn about the dangers inherent in our growing national debt. He was very clear about this much: the debt and its associated dangers are massive, explosive, perhaps even apocalyptic. He was entire unclear, however, about exactly what those dangers are.\n\n\nPressed for an explanation, Mr. Sakowicz rather breathlessly announced that every child born in America today is born with a $45,000 share of the national debt. (He should have said the average child and $45,000 is probably not the right number, but those are minor quibbles). The host, bless him, asked exactly the right question, namely \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d. To which Mr. Sakowicz attempted to clarify his meaning by repeating the $45,000 figure in a considerably more agitated tone of voice. To which the host calmly replied: \u201cOkay, but what does that mean? Take my daughter, for example. Exactly how does this affect her life? Does it meant that she\u2019ll pay that much more in taxes\u2026..or what?\u201d. To which Mr. Sakowicz replied that $45,000 is a really big pile of money.\n\nWell, yes, $45,000 is a really big pile of money, but the host\u2019s question was exactly on target. When we say that an American child is born owing $45,000, (or $40,000, or $350,000) what does that mean for the life of the child?\n\nAnswer: Pretty much nothing. What matters to your kids is not their share of the national debt, but their overall inheritance. There are two parts to that inheritance. First, there\u2019s what your kids get directly from you. Second, there are the factories, machines and tools that other kids inherit, creating opportunities for your kids to earn higher wages.\n\nWhat we collectively leave our kids is equal to what we collectively produce minus what we collectively use up. When the government commissions someone to build, say, a tank or a highway or a bridge to nowhere, using, say, a million dollars\u2019 worth of resources, those resources are subtracted from the next generation\u2019s inheritance\u2014partly from your own kids\u2019 and partly from other people\u2019s kids\u2019, which affects your kids\u2019 wages. If you like, you can (perhaps partly) compensate for your kids\u2019 share of that burden by tightening your belt and leaving a little more in your bequest. But the moral is that it\u2019s government spending, not government debt that has the potential to impoverish our children.\n\nTo see that debt is not the culprit, suppose for a moment that we decide to eliminate the debt tomorrow by raising taxes, so the average American forks over $40,000. What does that do for the average child who\u2019s born tomorrow? It removes a $40,000 debt burden and simultaneously cuts his inheritance by $40,000. How is that child\u2019s life affected? To a good first approximation, not at all. (I am glossing over some complications here, but they are of relatively minor importance.) And of course that calculation makes perfect sense because the only way you can make the next generation richer is by conserving actual resources\u2014which you can\u2019t accomplish with accounting tricks.\n\nAh! you might say, but we\u2019ve done more than that\u2014we\u2019ve saved that child not just from $40,000 in debt but also from a lifetime of accumulated interest on that debt. Yes, and we\u2019ve also robbed that child of not just $40,000 in inheritance but also of a lifetime of accumulated interest on that inheritance. It all washes out.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so frustrating to hear talk of blue ribbon commissions assigned to the task of \u201cdebt reduction\u201d. \u201cDebt reduction\u201d can mean less spending, or more taxes, or some combination thereof. But to raise taxes solely for the purpose of debt reduction is to mask the problem, not to solve it. Debt is not the problem; spending is. Hysteria about the debt is misdirection.",

The limitation was in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBackground\nAs a response to the disaster, on 30 April President Barack Obama ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed[1] and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.[2]\n\nOn May 27 the United States Department of the Interior issued a press release stating that Salazar would issue a 6-month offshore drilling (below 500 feet (150 m) of water) moratorium in the area.[3][4] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.[5] In a May 30 announcement of the limitation Salazar said:\n\nThe six month moratorium on deepwater drilling will provide time to implement new safety requirements and to allow the Presidential Commission to complete its work... Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirements, but deepwater drilling operations must safely come to a halt. With the BP oil spill still growing in the Gulf, and investigations and reviews still underway, a six month pause in drilling is needed, appropriate, and prudent.[6]\n\nIt was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. The moratorium was to impact 33 deepwater drilling sites, less than 1% of the 3,600 oil and natural gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.[4][7] Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.[8]\n\nLitigation\nMain article: Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar\nSoon after, Hornbeck Offshore Services, a company with financial interests in deepwater drilling, filed suit in the Eastern District of Louisiana District Court seeking an injunction to ban enforcement. Judge Martin Feldman issued a decision for Hornbeck on Tuesday, June 22, 2010, granting a preliminary injunction, barring enforcement of the order.[4][9]\n\nThe White House appealed the injunction. On July 8 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, ruled against a stay of injunction, saying the administration failed to show how it would be irreparably harmed if the stay was not granted. The court also said that the administration also 'made no showing that there is any likelihood that drilling activities will be resumed pending appeal.'[10]\n\nSalazar has indicated that the Department of the Interior will 'issue a new order in the coming days that eliminates any doubt that a moratorium is needed, appropriate, and within our authorities.'[11][12]\n\nFurther steps\nThe Obama administration assembled a panel to advise his administration on how to address offshore drilling in the wake of the spill. The group have stated that Salazar's May 27 report to Obama portrayed their approval of the moratorium, they claim that the panel reviewed a previous draft of the document with bans only on new drilling in water deeper than 1,000 feet.[13][14]\n\nOn 30 June, Salazar said that 'he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium'.[15] Michael Bromwich, the head of the newly created Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said that a record of 'bad performance, deadly performance' by an oil company should be considered 'a relevant factor' for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.[15] Representative George Miller plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the United States House of Representatives that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of 'extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations'.[16]\n\nThe ban was lifted in October 2010, but by February 2011 no one had received a permit to drill because those applying had to prove the ability to contain a spill. A group that included Exxon had developed a system with this capability.[17]\n\nIn July 2011 The Heritage Foundation's Robert Bluey reported at Scribe that deepwater drilling permits were down 71% from their historical monthly average of 5.9 permits per month, while shallow-water permits were off 34% from their historical 7.1 monthly average permits.[18]",

He later outright canceled the Virginia\nlease sale.\no In June 2012, the President announced an even more restrictive offshore drilling plan\nthat locks-up 85 percent of offshore areas.

By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of 'extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations'.[16]\n\nThe ban was lifted in October 2010, but by February 2011 no one had received a permit to drill because those applying had to prove the ability to contain a spill. A group that included Exxon had developed a system with this capability.[17]\n\nIn July 2011 The Heritage Foundation's Robert Bluey reported at Scribe that deepwater drilling permits were down 71% from their historical monthly average of 5.9 permits per month, while shallow-water permits were off 34% from their historical 7.1 monthly average permits.[18]\n",
        "llm_verdict": "This text is **misleading**, mainly because it compresses several different policy actions in 2010 and misstates their sequence and purpose.\n\n**Why it is misleading**\n\n* In **April 2010**, President Obama *did* order a pause on issuing **new offshore drilling leases** after the Deepwater Horizon disaster while safety reviews were conducted. This was not an announcement of \u201cwhat areas he would close,\u201d but a temporary halt pending investigation, as documented in contemporaneous reporting: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill_economic_and_environmental_consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill_economic_and_environmental_consequences)\n* On **May 30, 2010**, the administration then imposed a **6-month deepwater drilling moratorium** for safety reasons, not because areas were already \u201copen\u201d or because Obama was attempting to close them. This response is described here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill_economic_and_environmental_consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill_economic_and_environmental_consequences)\n* These actions were *reactions* to the spill, not part of a broader leasing-expansion policy. They did not \u201cre-close\u201d previously opened areas; they temporarily suspended deepwater operations during an emergency.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe text misrepresents Obama\u2019s April 2010 actions: he neither affirmed that all areas were previously open nor simply \u201cannounced closures.\u201d Instead, his administration paused new leasing and later imposed a safety moratorium after the spill, which is well-documented in contemporaneous sources.\n"
